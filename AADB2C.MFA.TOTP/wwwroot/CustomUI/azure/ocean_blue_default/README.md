# Default Ocean Blue

These files were downloaded from the template links in [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/contentdefinitions#content-definition-ids). The links in the documentation are to the default UI but by changing "/default/" to "/templates/AzureBlue/" in each link then Ocean Blue versions can be obtained.

They work with the latest [Page Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/page-layout) used in [Content Definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/contentdefinitions)

They are stand-alone html files (unlike the Sample Ocean Blue files at CustomUI/azure/ocean_blue_sample which split up images, css and html etc. so rely on the files in CustomUI/azure/assets)
