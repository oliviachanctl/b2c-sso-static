# Sample Ocean Blue

These files were downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-AD-B2C-page-templates/tree/master/ocean_blue) as per [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/customize-ui-with-html?pivots=b2c-custom-policy#sample-templates)

They work with v1.2.0 [Page Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/page-layout) used in [Content Definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/contentdefinitions) but do not yet support v2.0.0 Page Layouts for things like [Display Controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/display-controls)

They nicely split up images, css and html etc. so rely on the files in CustomUI/azure/assets

The Default Ocean Blue files at CustomUI/azure/ocean_blue_default support v2.0.0 Page Layouts and are stand-alone html files
