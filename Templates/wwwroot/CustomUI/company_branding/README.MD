# Company Branding

In case a default HTML template is used based on the Azure Ocean Blue UI (perhaps because a client has not created a custom template) then the Azure B2C Company Branding tool should be configured to apply minimal branding to the default template.

## Banner Logo

Replaces the small grey box image just above the inject page content. CenturyLink and Lumen PNG files can be configured as appropriate.

## Background Image

Replaces the background image. Be sure to also set an appropriate background color.
