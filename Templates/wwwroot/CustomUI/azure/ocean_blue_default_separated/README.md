These files are the same as CustomUI/azure/ocean_blue_default except they have been processed to separate the CSS and images etc.

This makes them more closely match the CustomUI/azure/ocean_blue_sample files whilst also supporting the latest [Page Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/page-layout) used in [Content Definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/contentdefinitions)
